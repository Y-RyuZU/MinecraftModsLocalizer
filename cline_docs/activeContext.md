# Active Context

## What I'm Working On Now
Based on the tasks document (`/docs/tasks.md`), I'm currently focusing on the highest priority tasks:

### Project Initialization and Basic Structure
- Setting up the Tauri + Next.js project
- Defining the directory structure
- Creating basic configuration files

This is the first step in the development plan and involves establishing the foundation for the application.

## Recent Changes
As this is the initial setup phase, there are no recent changes to report yet. The project is being set up from scratch.

## Next Steps
After completing the project initialization, the next steps will be:

1. **Core Architecture Design**
   - Design LLM adapter interface
   - Design implementation classes for each LLM API
   - Design overall system dependencies

2. **Data Model Design**
   - Define configuration data model
   - Define translation data model
   - Design application state management (zustand)

3. **File Operation Core Feature Design**
   - Design jar file analysis module
   - Design file reading/writing utilities
   - Design resource pack generation functionality

These steps will establish the architectural foundation for the application before moving on to implementing the main features.
