# TASK_010: Fix Tauri Errors and Implement Mod-Level Progress Tracking

**Created**: 2025-06-18  
**Status**: Completed  
**Updated**: 2025-06-18 01:56:21  
**Completed**: 2025-06-18 01:56:21  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Type**: Bug Fix

## Problem Statement

Two critical issues affecting mod translation functionality:

1. **Tauri Command Errors**: Backend mod analysis failing with:
   - `Error invoking Tauri command analyze_mod_jar: "Lang file error: Failed to parse data/libertyvillagers/lang/en_us.json: invalid escape at line 31 column 57"`
   - `Error invoking Tauri command analyze_mod_jar: "IO error: stream did not contain valid UTF-8"`

2. **Incorrect Progress Calculation**: Despite previous fixes, overall progress reaches 100% around the "F" section when processing mods alphabetically from A to Z. The progress should track completed mods, not chunks.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Tauri Command Errors
- **JSON Parsing Error**: Invalid escape sequences in mod lang files causing parse failures
- **UTF-8 Encoding Error**: Non-UTF-8 content in mod files causing read failures
- These errors crash the analysis phase and prevent mods from being translated

### Progress Calculation Issues
The current implementation tracks chunk completion rather than mod completion:
- **Current**: `(completed chunks / total chunks) * 100`
- **Required**: `(completed mods / total mods) * 100`

The user specifically clarified that denominator should be total number of mods to be translated, and numerator should be number of completed mod translations.

## Technical Implementation

### Files to Modify

**Tauri Error Handling:**
- `src-tauri/src/minecraft/mod.rs` - Add error handling for JSON parsing and UTF-8 issues
- `src/components/tabs/mods-tab.tsx` - Handle backend errors gracefully in frontend
- `src/lib/services/file-service.ts` - Add error recovery for failed mod analysis

**Progress Calculation Fix:**
- `src/components/tabs/mods-tab.tsx` - Implement mod-level progress tracking
- `src/lib/store/index.ts` - Add mod-level progress state management
- `src/lib/services/translation-runner.ts` - Update to track mod completion instead of chunks

### Implementation Approach

#### Tauri Error Handling
1. Add try-catch blocks with specific error handling for JSON parse failures
2. Implement UTF-8 validation and fallback strategies
3. Gracefully skip problematic mods with user notification
4. Continue processing other mods when errors occur

#### Mod-Level Progress Tracking
1. Replace chunk-based progress with mod-based progress
2. Track: `totalMods` and `completedMods` instead of `totalChunks` and `completedChunks`
3. Update progress calculation to `(completedMods / totalMods) * 100`
4. Increment progress only when an entire mod translation is complete

## Acceptance Criteria

### Error Handling
- [ ] Invalid JSON escape sequences in mod lang files are handled gracefully
- [ ] Non-UTF-8 content in mod files is handled without crashing
- [ ] Problematic mods are skipped with appropriate user notification
- [ ] Other mods continue processing when errors occur
- [ ] Error details are logged for debugging

### Progress Calculation
- [ ] Progress tracks completed mods, not chunks
- [ ] Denominator equals total number of selected mods
- [ ] Numerator equals number of fully completed mod translations
- [ ] Progress reaches 100% only when all mods are completely finished
- [ ] Progress updates are accurate throughout the entire A-Z processing

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Test with mods containing invalid JSON escape sequences
- [ ] Test with mods containing non-UTF-8 content
- [ ] Test progress accuracy with 10+ mods processing alphabetically
- [ ] Verify progress reaches 100% only at true completion
- [ ] Test error recovery and continued processing

## Architecture Alignment

This task maintains architectural consistency by:
- Improving error resilience in the backend layer
- Following established progress tracking patterns
- Preserving existing component boundaries
- Using established Zustand store patterns

## Dependencies

- Requires backend Rust error handling improvements
- Builds on existing translation infrastructure
- Uses current state management patterns

## Risk Assessment

**Medium Risk**: Backend changes to error handling require careful testing to ensure no regressions in mod analysis functionality.
